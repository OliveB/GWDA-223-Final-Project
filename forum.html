					<h2 class="topic-head">Employee Policies</h2>
					<p class="pre-line">
						While each employee will have a specific set of duties, all employees are subject to a common set of goals and obligations. If you know of a fellow employee who is/has been/might be in violation of one or more of these tenets, or if you are/have been/might be in violation of one or more of these tenets, please do not hesitate to report such incident to Security.
					
						Effective use of time. Because at InGen, we understand that life offers only one certainty: Here today, extinct tomorrow.
					
						Utter compliance with InGen's non-disclosure and confidentiality policies. This includes the reporting of all suspicious persons or incidents as well as any and all violations, confirmed or otherwise, to Security.
					
						Friendliness, courtesy and respect to man and beast, whether co-worker, park visitor or dinosaur.
					
						Regular attendance. InGen employees are not tardy, do not abuse sick leave, lunch periods or breaks.
					
						To work when you are supposed to be working, and to perform the job you are supposed to be performing. While InGen will never condone a violation of this policy, it is understood that in certain emergency situations, an employee might be forced to perform the job of an absent colleague. For example, he/she might put out a small fire him/herself instead of waiting for Security forces to arrive. While it is doubtful that the said employee would be reprimanded for such a violation, it is generally safest to check with a supervisor first.
					
						Observance of all safety and security policies as dictated. When appropriate, please observe the instructions issued by the computer-generated voice. Please see the Emergency Procedures section for more information.
					
						Proper use of and respect towards InGen property. This includes, but is not limited to: safe handling of dangerous materials; appropriate (i.e., job-related) use only of facilities.
					
						Keeping an eye out for cost-saving and labor-saving approaches to your assignments and to report them to your supervisor.

						In our ongoing commitment to the InGen family, we are planning to build a Daycare Facility next to the Hatchery. Construction begins next week. (Contact: Steve Hyland, Employee Relations)

						Paid maternity and paternity leave can be arranged, as long as it is at least two months in advance. (Contact: Maria Dillinger, Personnel Director)

					<h2 class="topic-head">How Do I Know it's an Emergancy?</h2>
					<p class="pre-line">
						An emergency situation, when monitored by ASYA (Automatic SYstems Analysis), will be signaled by a warning klaxon. An automated female voice will describe the nature of the situation and issue specific instructions.
					</p>

					<h2 class="topic-head">What is an Emergancy?</h2>
					<p class="pre-line">
						An emergency is generally defined as an unforeseen combination of circumstances requiring immediate action. Some examples include:

						Power Outages. Generally, these result from an overload of some sort. The breaker switch for the complex is located in the Power Room on Level One.

						Fire. InGen is equipped with a state-of-the-art Halon Gas System (HGS) that, in the event of fire, will remove all of the oxygen from the room, effectively snuffing the flame. A warning will be issued before the gas is emitted. In the unlikely event that a person is in the room at the same time, he or she should immediately look for the override switch, usually located in an adjacent corridor.

						Escaped Dinosaurs. In the unlikely event of an escaped dinosaur, all employees should immediately evacuate, as the complex will be sealed. The Director of Operations is responsible for remaining behind to immobilize (or, in extreme cases, terminate) the fugitive animal.

						Enemy Invasion. In cases of enemy invasion, responsibility for the Park falls into the hands of Security, who will manage the situation until proper police or military officials can be summoned.
						
						Viral Infection. Due to the delicate balance of Jurassic Park, even the slightest potential of contagion must be handled with utmost care. In the event of a suspected virus, the Complex will be quarantined and sealed. Employees should await further instructions which will be forthcoming.
