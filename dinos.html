				<p>-The Tyrannosaurus rex, commonly abbreviated to T.rex, is a fixture in popular culture. It lived throughout what is now western North America, which then was an island continent named Laramidia, with a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hindlimbs, Tyrannosaurus forlimbs were small but were unusually powerful for their size and bore two clawed digits. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it was the largest known tyrannosaurid and one of the largest known land predators; the most complete specimen measures up to 12.3m in length, up to 4 meters tall at the hips, and up to 6.8 metric tons in weight. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, tyrannosaurus rex may have been an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, and possibly sauropods, although some experts have suggested it was primarily a scavenger. The debate about whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or scavenger was among the longest running in paleontology; however, most scientists now agree that Tyrannosaurus rex was an opportunistic carnivore, both predating and scavenging. A 2012 study by scientists Karl Bates and Peter Falkingham suggested that the bite force of Tyrannosaurus could have been the strongesgt of any terrestrial animal that has ever lived. The calculations suggested that adult T.rex could have generated from 35,000 to 57,000 newtons of force in the back teeth, or the equivalent of three times the force estimated for a great white shark, 15 times the force of an African lion, 3 1/2 times the force of an Australian saltwater crocodile and around 7 times the estimated force for Allosaurus. However, even higher estimates were made by professor Mason B. Meers of the University of Tampa in 2003. in his study, Meers estimated a possible bite force of around 183,000 to 235,000 newtons or 18.3 to 23.5 metric tons; a bite force equivalent to that of the largest Megalodon shark specimens.</p>
