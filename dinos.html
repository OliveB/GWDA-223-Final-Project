				<p>-The Tyrannosaurus rex, commonly abbreviated to T.rex, is a fixture in popular culture. It lived throughout what is now western North America, which then was an island continent named Laramidia, with a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hindlimbs, Tyrannosaurus forlimbs were small but were unusually powerful for their size and bore two clawed digits. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it was the largest known tyrannosaurid and one of the largest known land predators; the most complete specimen measures up to 12.3m in length, up to 4 meters tall at the hips, and up to 6.8 metric tons in weight. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, tyrannosaurus rex may have been an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, and possibly sauropods, although some experts have suggested it was primarily a scavenger. The debate about whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or scavenger was among the longest running in paleontology; however, most scientists now agree that Tyrannosaurus rex was an opportunistic carnivore, both predating and scavenging. A 2012 study by scientists Karl Bates and Peter Falkingham suggested that the bite force of Tyrannosaurus could have been the strongesgt of any terrestrial animal that has ever lived. The calculations suggested that adult T.rex could have generated from 35,000 to 57,000 newtons of force in the back teeth, or the equivalent of three times the force estimated for a great white shark, 15 times the force of an African lion, 3 1/2 times the force of an Australian saltwater crocodile and around 7 times the estimated force for Allosaurus. However, even higher estimates were made by professor Mason B. Meers of the University of Tampa in 2003. in his study, Meers estimated a possible bite force of around 183,000 to 235,000 newtons or 18.3 to 23.5 metric tons; a bite force equivalent to that of the largest Megalodon shark specimens.</p>

				<p>-Velociraptors is a gens of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 75 to 71 million years ago during the later part of the Cretaceous Period. Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator, Velociraptor nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features. It was a bipedial, feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle prey. Velociraptors can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout. In the Jurassic Park motion picture series, the Velociraptor had some anatomical inaccuracies, including being much larger than it was in reality and without feathers. Some of these inaccuracies, along with the head's larger dome in the movies may suggest that the dinosaurs in the movies were actually modeled on Deinonychus. Velociraptor was a mid-sized dromaeosaurid, with adults measuring up to 2.07m long, 0.5m high at the hip, and weighing up to 15kg. The skull, which grew up to 25cm long, was uniquely up-curved, concave on the upper surface and convex on the lower. The jaws were lined with 26-28 widely spaced teeth on each side, each more strongly serrated on the back edge than the front. Velociraptors, like other dromaeosaurids, had large hands with three strongly curved claws, which were similar in construction and flexibility to the wing bones of modern birds. The second digit was the longest of the three digits present, while the first was shortest. The structure of the wrist bones prevented pronation of the wrist and forced the hands to be held with the palmar surface facing inwards, not downwards. As in other dromaeosaurs, the Velociraptor tails had long bony projections on the upper surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail to act as a single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.</p>

			<div class="tric dino">

				<p>Triceratops is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that first appeared during the late Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago in what is now North America. It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur genera, and became extince in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. The term triceratops, which means "three-horned face", is derived from the Greek τρί- meaning "three," κέρας meaning "horn," and ὤψ meaning "face." Bearing a large bony frill and three horns on its large four-legged body, and conjuring similarities with the modern rhinoceros, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best known certopsid. It shared the landscape with and was preyed upon by the fearsome Tyrannosaurus. The function of the frills and three distinctive facial horns has long inspired debate. Traditionally these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of blood vessels in the skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probably that these features were primarily used in identification, courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros bettles. Individual Triceraptops are estimated to have reached about 7.9 to 9.0m in length, 2.9 to 3.0m in height, and 13,000-26,000lbs in weight. The most distinctive feature is their large skull, among the largest of all land animals. The largest known skull is estimated to have been 2.5 meters in length when complete, and could reach almost a third of the length of the entire animal. It bore a single horn on the snout, above the nostrils, and a pair of horns approximately 1m long, with one above each eye. To the rear of the skull was a relatively short, bony frill, adorned with epoccipitals in some specimens. Most other ceratopsidshad large fenestrae in their frills, while those of triceratops were noticeably solid. Triceratops species possessed a sturdy build, wit hstrong limbs, short hands with three hooves each, and short feet with four hooves each. Although certainly quadrupedal, the posture of these dinosaurs has long been the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax, in order to better bear the weight of the head.</p>
